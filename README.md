## ECC
- ecc key gen
- privKey -> []byte
- []byte -> privKey
- pubKey -> []byte
- []byte -> pubKey
- encode pubKey to asn1 der
- decode asn1 der to pubKey

## ECDH

- takes in a public key and a private key and generates a shared secret

## ECDSA

- sign and verify

## ECIES

- use ecc to encrypt and decrypt

## HE-Paillier
